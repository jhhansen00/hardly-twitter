The view reply/edit/delete post/reply page

Hardly Twitter is exactly what it seems like, it's my attempt at making twitter with my current skills, so far you can make and view posts as well as reply to posts and view other's replies. If it is your post you can edit, or delete the post with all it's replies, and you can also delete any replies you have left incase of a type or you just don't like it anymore.
